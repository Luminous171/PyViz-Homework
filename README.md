### How to use the dashboard

This readme explains how to use the dashboard. Simply open and execute the code in the file dashboard_EH.ipynb.
The charts will appear as tabs towards the bottom of the notebook organized by each type of visual.

Most of the plots are interactive.

1. hvPlot - This type of plot features a drop down to change the neighborhood.
2. Plotly - These are special types of charts called parallel categories that can be moved by clicking and dragging.
3. Mapbox - A map chart that can zoom and hover to see geographic coordinates with data.
